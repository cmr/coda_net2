(** An interface to limited libp2p functionality for Coda to use. 

A subprocess is spawned to run the go-libp2p code. This module communicates
with that subprocess over an ad-hoc RPC protocol.

TODO: separate internal helper errors from underlying libp2p errors.

In general, functions in this module return ['a Deferred.Or_error.t]. Unless
otherwise mentioned, the deferred is resolved immediately once the RPC action
to the libp2p helper is finished. Unless otherwise mentioned, everything can
fail due to an internal helper error. These indicate a bug in this module,
and not misuse.
